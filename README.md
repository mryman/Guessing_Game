Guessing_Game

This piece of code represents a simple game.  It includes several alerts and prompts to the player.
The game will first inform the user that they can only make three attempts to arrive at a correct answer.
The  game then prompts the user for input for their first attempt.
The input is tested against a calculated value to determine whether it is true or false.
If the answer is true, the user is congratulated and the game exits.
If the answer is false, the user is prompted to try again for the remaining 2nd and third attempts, with each input being tested in the same fashion as the first.
If all three attempts fail, the user is notified that they have reached their maximum number of attempts and the game exits.

Working through syntax issues, and ideas for logic controls to limit the game to three attempts, were aided by discussing with Mike, who was using a similar overall structure for his program.
